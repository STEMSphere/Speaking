      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Why do most kids study English for years and still struggle to speak?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> Because they learn with books, not with their voice. They memorize grammar, vocabulary, and rules. But real English happens when we speak it.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So speaking is not just part of learning — it’s the best way?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> Yes. The fastest way to learn English is to speak it. Not just in class — but in front of people. Public speaking trains confidence, expression, and clear thinking.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Is public speaking okay for beginners?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> Of course. We start small. First, short sentences. Then storytelling. Students learn how to speak with emotion, make eye contact, and feel proud of their words.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That sounds very different.</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> It is. At STEMSphere, we teach English by speaking. Our students don’t sit quietly — they stand and speak clearly. They stop thinking in their language and start thinking in English.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Can you show an example?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> Sure. (Here you could use the apple example — show how tone changes the meaning.)</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That’s powerful.</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> It works. Not just for English — but also for science, math, and coding. We build strong speakers who can explain ideas anywhere.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> But you’re a STEM program. Why English?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> Because every STEM student needs to speak well — for presentations, interviews, and leadership. Public speaking helps students use English in real life.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> And this helps fast?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> Yes. Parents say they see change after 2–3 weeks. Students speak better, think faster, and feel confident.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What makes your course special?</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> We teach with real coaches — not just videos. Students can study on their own, join group classes, or get 1-on-1 help. We support families across Asia.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That apple example still sticks with me.</p>
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> That’s why we teach this way. Our training is simple, clear, and fun. Students don’t read scripts — they speak from their heart.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>Me:</strong> If you’re a parent watching this and thinking:<br>
      “My child knows English but doesn’t speak with confidence…”<br>
      This course is for you.</p>
